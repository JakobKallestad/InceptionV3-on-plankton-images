!We didnt include the models we trained because the files are large!
We can hand them in if needed.

For the cifar10 experiment:

- 'create_cifar10data_images.ipynb':
Downloads, upscales and saves the cifar dataset as .jpg files locally.

- 'inceptionV3_on_cifar10.ipynb'
Runs the InceptionV3 model from keras on the cifar10 dataset and saves
the model, tensorboard graphs and confusion matrix locally.

- 'running_cifar10_model_on_testset.ipynb'
Runs the model on the testset and outputs accuracy and confusion matrix.

For the Plankton experiment:

You need the plankton data folder to run this:
- 'incpetionV3 _ on_plankton.ipynb'
Runs the InceptionV3 model from keras on the Plankton dataset and saves
the model, tensorboard graphs and confusion matrix locally.

- 'running_plankton_model_on_testset.ipynb'
Runs the model on the testset and outputs accuracy and confusion matrix.
